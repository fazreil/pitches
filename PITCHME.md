## Practical use of VCS


+++

### update your code frequently
  - To avoid conflicts, update code frequently
  - it will be best to work on the latest code
  - conflicts might are not just at the code level, but branch level

+++

### manage conflicts diligently
  - Keep changes to their respective commits
  - if there are multiple changes that are irrelevant to each other, it will be hard to manage the commits

+++

### commit relevant changes with relevant message
  - Best to group a commit to relevant files being modified.
  - while committing a bunch of files is easy, committing the files with common commit makes the log more readable.

+++

### VCS is not just for coding
  - VCS can be utilised to record changes of files.
  - Work best with plaintext.
  - Can also work with keeping configuration files of applications.
